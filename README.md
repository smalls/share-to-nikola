A [Workflow](https://workflow.is/) to post links from your iPhone to a [Nikola blog](https://getnikola.com/blog/) (via [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)).

There are other integrations to post a full article (via Working Copy's integrations with [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) or [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/), but I wanted something more streamlined to share links easily. 

This doesn't do the `git commit` or `git push` for you, in case there are edits that you'd like to make. It'd be easy to add those, but doing them manually isn't hard and gives you a chance to make edits.
