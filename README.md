[Workflow](https://workflow.is/) to post links from your iPhone to a [Nikola blog](https://getnikola.com/blog/) (via [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)).

There are other integrations to post a full article (via Working Copy's integrations with [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) or [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/). 

To fully post you'll need to be able to have a git push cause your posted blog to be refreshed.
