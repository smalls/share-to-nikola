This repo contains a few different ways to streamline posting to [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/blog/) from an iPhone. 

All of these use [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) as the communication medium. Your process should allow a `git push` to refresh the hosted version.

#Sharing URLs
The workflow directory contains a [Workflow](https://workflow.is/) to share links (via [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/.

There are other integrations to post a full article (via Working Copy's integrations with [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) or [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/), but I wanted something more streamlined to share links easily. 

This doesn't do the `git commit` or `git push` for you, in case there are edits that you'd like to make. It'd be easy to add those, but doing them manually isn't hard and gives you a chance to make edits.  

Direct link to the Workflow (you can install it straight from here): [workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/6y.mxJM2j3CqBuLTcVqsuuFX). 

More info on how this fits into my process at [b.splendous.net](http://b.splendous.net/posts/wc-editorial-integration/). 

#Editorial
From [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/), it's easy to post by copying or refreshing the file back to Working Copy. That won't create the header, though. 

So I've created a small Editorial workflow to either prepend a sample header or refresh the date in an existing one.
